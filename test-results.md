# Standalone Parsera Actor for Apify - Test Results

## Test Summary

This document contains the results of testing the standalone Parsera Apify actor implementation.

## Basic Functionality Test

The basic functionality test validates that the actor can:
1. Initialize properly with the required dependencies
2. Connect to a website using Playwright
3. Extract structured data using the LLM
4. Return results in the expected format

### Test Case: Hacker News Extraction

**URL**: https://news.ycombinator.com/
**Elements to Extract**:
- Title: News title
- Points: Number of points
- Comments: Number of comments

**Expected Result**: A list of news items with their titles, points, and comment counts.

**Actual Result**: The test successfully extracted multiple news items from the Hacker News homepage, with each item containing the requested fields.

## Validation Against Original Parsera

To validate that our standalone implementation matches the functionality of the original Parsera library, we compared the results of both implementations on the same input.

### Comparison Test

**URL**: https://news.ycombinator.com/
**Elements**: Same as above
**Results**: The standalone implementation produced structurally equivalent results to the original Parsera library, with minor variations in exact text extraction due to the nature of LLM-based extraction.

## Edge Case Testing

### Large Page Test
- **Description**: Testing extraction from a large webpage with many elements
- **Result**: Successfully handled the page without memory issues

### JavaScript-Heavy Site Test
- **Description**: Testing extraction from a site with heavy JavaScript usage
- **Result**: Successfully rendered and extracted content

### Error Handling Test
- **Description**: Testing behavior with invalid inputs and network errors
- **Result**: Properly handled errors with informative messages

## Performance Testing

- **Memory Usage**: Within acceptable limits for Apify's platform
- **Execution Time**: Comparable to the original Parsera library
- **Scalability**: Successfully handled multiple concurrent extractions

## Conclusion

The standalone Parsera Apify actor implementation successfully replicates the core functionality of the original Parsera library without relying on external API services. All tests passed, confirming that the actor is ready for deployment on the Apify platform.
